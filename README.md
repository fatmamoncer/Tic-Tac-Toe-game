# Tic Tac Toe Game (C++)

## Overview

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw. This project was developed as a fun coding exercise and a way to practice C++ programming.

## Features

- Two players can take turns to play the game.
- The game detects a win or a draw and ends appropriately.
- The board is displayed after each move to keep track of the game progress.
- The code is written in C++ and provides a simple example of a text-based game.
